We developed a console-based registration portal for CLH, and the code has been zipped and shared in the Batch 25 WhatsApp group. 
Students are expected to complete and submit it by Wednesday, January 22, 2025. Following this, they will begin working on their personal console applications,
which they will present on Wednesday, January 29, 2025.
