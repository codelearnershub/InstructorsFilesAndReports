1.  Write a C# program to implement a linear search algorithm.

Create an integer array of size 10.
Allow the user to input a number to search for in the array.
Display the index of the number if found, or a message if it is not in the array.

2.  Write a C# program to implement a binary search algorithm.

Use a sorted array of integers [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20].
Allow the user to input a number to search for in the array.
Display the index of the number if found, or a message if it is not in the array.

3.  Write two separate C# methods, one for linear search and one for binary search.

Use the array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100].
Search for the number 50 in both methods.
Write a brief explanation comparing the two methods in terms of efficiency.
