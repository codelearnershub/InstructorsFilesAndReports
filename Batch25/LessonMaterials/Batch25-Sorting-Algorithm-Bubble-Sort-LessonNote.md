Sorting Algorithm: Bubble Sort
Implement and Analyse Bubble Sort in c# (Batch 25)

Lecture Date : 28/01/2025.


Introduction:

Sorting algorithm is a method for arranging the elements of a list in a specific order. The sorting algorithms are used to arrange the data in both numerical
and lexicographical order.

Bubble Sort:

Bubble Sort is a simple and easy sorting algorithm. It begins by comparing the first two elements of a list.If the first element is greater than 
second element they are swapped. This process continues for each pair of adjacent element until the end of data set is reached. After completing one pass through the list,
The algorithm starts again from the first two elements and repeats the process until no swap has occured in the complete pass,
indicating that the list is sorted.

Goal of Teaching the Bubble Sort Algorithm to Students

The primary goal of teaching the Bubble Sort algorithm to students is to provide them with a foundational understanding of sorting algorithms and
their implementation.
