Demonstrates clear understanding of loop types (for, while, do-while, foreach) and their appropriate use cases (e.g., for for fixed iterations, foreach for collections).

Successfully applies loops to solve repetitive tasks, such as iterating through arrays, validating user input, or generating sequences.

Avoids infinite loops by properly updating loop variables and setting exit conditions.

Recognizes and fixes off-by-one errors in loop boundaries (e.g., i < 5 vs. i <= 5).

Overall:
The student grasps fundamental loop mechanics in C# and applies them effectively. With continued practice, they will gain confidence in tackling advanced looping challenges!
