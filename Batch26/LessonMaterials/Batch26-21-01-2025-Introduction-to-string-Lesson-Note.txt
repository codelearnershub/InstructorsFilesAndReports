		Understanding String Representation and Operation.

Lesson Date: 21/01/2025

Introduction
Strings are one of the most fundamental data types in programming, serving as the backbone for text manipulation 
and representation in various applications. In C#, a string is defined as a sequence of characters, which can include letters,
numbers, symbols, and whitespace. The ability to work with strings effectively is crucial for tasks such as user input handling, 
data processing, and output formatting.

In C#, strings are represented by the System.String class, which provides a rich set of methods and properties for string manipulation.
This class allows developers to perform a wide range of operations, including concatenation, comparison, searching, and formatting. 
Understanding how strings are represented and the operations that can be performed on them is essential for writing efficient and effective C# code.


Goal of this Topic:

To provide students with a solid foundation in the concept of strings, including their definition, characteristics,
and importance in programming.
To enable students to perform various string operations, such as concatenation, substring extraction, searching, 
and formatting, thereby enhancing their ability to manipulate text data effectively.
To help students grasp the concept of string immutability in C#, which is crucial for writing efficient code and understanding memory management.
