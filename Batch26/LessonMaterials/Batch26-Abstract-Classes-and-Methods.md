Abstract Classes and Methods.

(Batch 26).

Lesson Date: 11/02/2025.

Introduction.
An abstract class serves as a blueprint for other classes. It cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be inherited by subclasses.
Abstract classes can contain both abstract methods (which have no implementation) and concrete methods (which do have implementation). 
This allows for a mix of defined behavior and enforced structure in derived classes.

Abstract Methods: An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation. 
Subclasses that inherit from the abstract class are required to provide concrete implementations for these methods. 
This enforces a contract that ensures certain methods are implemented in derived classes,
promoting consistency across different implementations.
