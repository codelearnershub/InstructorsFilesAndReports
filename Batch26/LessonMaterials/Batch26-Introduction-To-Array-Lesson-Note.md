Introduction To Array in c# (Batch 26)

Lesson Date: 30/01/2025

Introduction:

Array is the most basic collection in c#. You can think of an array as a collection of boxes, each one holding a single value. Each box has its
index starting at zero and ending at array length minus 1. We can also compare an array to a row of lockers or a shelf of books.Each locker or 
book has a specific position (index) and can hold a specific item (value).


Goal of this Course:
Teaching arrays helps students develop their algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.
Learning about arrays Introduces students to important programming concepts, such as variable declaration, indexing, and iteration. 
This helps them become more proficient in coding. In addition, students understand how data can be organized and accessed efficiently.
At the end of this course student should be able to:
