Polymorphism : Implement Method Overriding and Overloading.

(Batch 26).

Lesson Date: 11/02/2025.

Introduction.
polymorphism is one of the fundamental of oop concepts that enhances the flexibility and scalability of code. 
Derived from the Greek words "poly" (meaning many) and "morph" (meaning forms), polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class,
enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types).
