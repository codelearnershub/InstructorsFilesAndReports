//Topic : Declaring and initialization of varible

// variable declartion
// variable initializatio
// Re-assigning of value into a varible
// Best practice in naming a variable
// Characteristic of a variable
// The concept of default value
// Type Casting and Type Conversion (Implicit and Exlicit casting)
// Cascading Operator

Key Terms:

Declaration: Creating a variable (int age;).

Initialization: Assigning a value (age = 25;).

Assignment: Updating a value (age = 26;).

3: Demonstrate type casting by converting a double to an int.
 4: Create variables to store your name (string), age (int), and GPA (double).

5: Cast a double to an int and explain data loss.

7: Write a program to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius using variables.
