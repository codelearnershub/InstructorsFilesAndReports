DataTypes


Lesson Outline
1. Introduction 
Icebreaker Question: "Why do you think specifying the type of data matters in programming?"
Define data types: Explain that a data type specifies the kind of data a variable can hold (e.g., integers, strings).
Emphasize why data types are critical for memory management, data integrity, and program performance.

2. Types of Data Types in C# 
Explain the two broad categories of data types in C#:

A. Value Types

Stored directly in memory.
Examples: int, float, double, bool, char, struct, enum.

B. Reference Types

Store references (memory addresses) instead of actual data.
Examples: string, array, class, delegate, interface.

Key Concept: The difference between value and reference types in terms of memory allocation and behavior during assignment.

Value Type vs. Reference Types
Memory allocation: Stack (value) vs. Heap (reference).

Assignment behavior: Copies vs. References

Primitive Type and Non-primitive Types

Conclusion
Reinforce the importance of choosing the correct data type
