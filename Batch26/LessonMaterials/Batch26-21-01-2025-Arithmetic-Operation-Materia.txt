Arithmetic Operation in c# (Batch 26)
Date: 21/01/2025

Introduction:

In C#, operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. 
They are essential for manipulating data and performing calculations in your programs. 
Operators form the foundation of any programming language.The functionality of c# language is incomplete without the use of operators.
Operators can be categorized into several types, with arithmetic operators being one of the most commonly used categories.


Goal of this course:

Operators are fundamental to performing calculations and manipulating data.
Teaching them helps students understand how to perform basic arithmetic operations, which are essential for any programming task.
Learning about operators encourages logical thinking and problem-solving skills. 
Students will learn to break down problems into smaller parts and use operators to manipulate data effectively
