Introduction To OOP (Batch 26)

Lesson Date : 04/02/2025.

Introduction:

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming style that organizes software design around data, or objects, 
rather than functions and logic. In OOP, we model real-world entities as objects that have attributes (data) and behaviors (methods).
This approach helps in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

Goal for Learning this course:
OOP allows you to create programs that are more intuitive and easier to understand by modeling real-world entities.
We will cover the following OOP concepts.

1. How do we Develop Applications?
