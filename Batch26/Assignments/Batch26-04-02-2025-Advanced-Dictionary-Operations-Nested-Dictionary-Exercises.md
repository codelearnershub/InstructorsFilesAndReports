Exercise Date : 04/02/2025

Question. 

1.Basic Understanding
  What is a nested generic dictionary in C#, and how does it differ from a standard generic dictionary

2.Declaration
  Write a C# code snippet to declare a nested generic dictionary where the outer dictionary has string keys and 
  the inner dictionary has int keys and string values.

3.Initialization
  How can you initialize a nested generic dictionary with sample data using object initializers? Provide a code example.

4.Accessing Values
  Given a nested generic dictionary, how would you access a specific value in the inner dictionary? Write a code example to demonstrate this.

5.Adding Entries
  Explain how to add a new key-value pair to an inner dictionary within a nested generic dictionary. Provide a code example.

6.Iterating Through Nested Dictionaries
  Write a C# method that iterates through a nested generic dictionary and prints all the keys and values in a readable format.

7. Removing Entries
  How can you remove a key-value pair from an inner dictionary in a nested generic dictionary? Provide a code example.

8. Checking for Existence
  How can you check if a specific key exists in the inner dictionary of a nested generic dictionary? Write a code snippet to illustrate this.

9.Use Case Scenario
  Describe a real-world scenario where a nested generic dictionary would be an appropriate data structure to use.
  Explain why it is suitable for that scenario.

10.Performance Considerations
   Discuss any performance considerations or limitations when using nested generic dictionaries in C#. What should a developer keep in mind?
