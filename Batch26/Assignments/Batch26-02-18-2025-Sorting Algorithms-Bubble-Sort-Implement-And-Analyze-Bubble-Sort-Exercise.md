Exercise 1: 

Task: Implement a basic Bubble Sort algorithm in C#. Given an array of integers, 
sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort technique.

Exercise 2:

Task: Modify your Bubble Sort implementation to include an optimization that stops the algorithm if no swaps are made during a pass. 
This can improve performance for nearly sorted arrays.

Exercise 3:

Write a method that sorts an array of integers in descending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Exercise 4:

Implement a Bubble Sort algorithm that counts the number of swaps made during the sorting process.
Return the total number of swaps after sorting the array.

Exercise 5:

Write a Bubble Sort method that sorts an array of strings in alphabetical order. Test your implementation with an array of names.

Exercise 6:
 
Create a class called Person with properties Name and Age and DateOfBirth. 
Implement a Bubble Sort algorithm to sort a list of Person objects by DateOfBirth.

Exercise 7:

Write a method that sorts a 2D array (matrix) based on the values in the first column using the Bubble Sort algorithm. 
If two rows have the same value in the first column, maintain their original order.

Exercise 8:

Implement a Bubble Sort algorithm that accepts a comparison delegate (Func) to allow sorting based on custom criteria (e.g., ascending, descending, or based on specific properties of objects).

Exercise 9:
Create a console application that visualizes the Bubble Sort process. Print the array after each swap to show how the sorting progresses.

Exercise 10:

Task: Write a Bubble Sort method that sorts an array of double values in ascending order.
 Test your implementation with an array of floating-point numbers.

Exercise 11:

Before performing Bubble Sort, write a method that checks if an array is already sorted. 
If it is sorted, return the original array without sorting.

Exercise 12:
Create a console application that prompts the user to enter a series of integers.
Store the integers in an array and then sort the array using the Bubble Sort algorithm. Finally, Implement binary search on the sorted array.
