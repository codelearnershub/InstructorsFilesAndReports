Exercise 1:

Task: Implement a basic binary search algorithm in C#. Given a sorted array of integers and a target integer, 
return the index of the target if it exists in the array; otherwise, return -1.

Exercise 2:

Task: Modify your binary search implementation to use recursion instead of iteration. 
Write a recursive method that takes a sorted array and a target value and returns the index of the target.

Exercise 3:

Task: Write a method that uses binary search to find the number of occurrences of a given target value in a sorted array. 
Return the count of occurrences.

Exercise 4:

Implement a method that finds the first and last position of a target value in a sorted array. 
Return the positions as a tuple (firstIndex, lastIndex). If the target is not found, return (-1, -1).

Exercise 5:

Write a method that takes a sorted array and a target value and returns the index at which the target should be inserted to maintain
the sorted order. If the target already exists, return its index.

Exercise 6: 

Given a rotated sorted array, implement a binary search algorithm to find the minimum element in the array.
The array was originally sorted in ascending order but was rotated at some pivot.

Exercise 7:

Write a method that searches for a target value in a rotated sorted array. Return the index of the target if found, or -1 if not found.

Exercise 8:
Implement a binary search algorithm to find a peak element in an array. 
An element is considered a peak if it is greater than or equal to its neighbors. The array may not be sorted.

Exercise 9:
Write a method that uses binary search to calculate the square root of a given non-negative integer. 
Return the integer part of the square root (i.e., the largest integer x such that x * x <= n).

Exercise 10:

Given a k x k sorted matrix (where each row and column is sorted), 
implement a binary search algorithm to find the kth smallest element in the matrix.
