Variable assignment

//1. (Compute the volume of a cylinder) Write a program that reads in the radius and length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:area = radius* radius pie
//volume = area * length

//2.(Convert feet into meters) Write a program that reads a number in feet, converts it to meters, and displays the result.One foot is 0.305 meter

//3.(Perfect number) A positive integer is called a perfect number if it is equal to the  sum of all of its positive divisors, excluding itself.For example, 6 is the first perfect number because 6 = 3 + 2 + 1. The next is 28 = 14 + 7 + 4 + 2 +1. There are four perfect numbers less than 10,000. Write a program to find all   these four numbers.

//4. Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is Q = M * (finalTemperature – initialTemperature) * 4184 where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.

//5. Write a program that reads the subtotal and the gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity and total.  For example, if the user enters 10 for subtotal and 15% for gratuity rate, the program displays $1.5 as gratuity and $11.5 as total.

//6.Average acceleration is defined as the change of velocity divided by the time taken to make the change, as shown in thefollowing formula: Write a program that prompts the user to enter the starting velocity in meters/second, the ending velocity in meters/second, and the time span t in seconds, and displays the average acceleration.

//7. Write a C# Sharp program to print the result of dividing two numbers.

//8. Write a C# program to convert from Celsius degrees to Kelvin and Fahrenheit. C

//9. (Arithmetic) Write an app that asks the user to enter two integers, obtain them from the   user and displays their sum, product, difference, and quotient(division).
